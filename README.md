## Screenshots

## Features
- Complete:
  - [x] CSS syntax highlighting
  - [x] Dynamic input creation and validation based on `snippet` object.
  - [x] Live style updates to the DOM when a `watch` property is set on the `snippet` object.
  - [x] Event hooks on all requirements being met in an editor

- Todo:
  - [ ] CSS highlighting for `@import` statements and flags, such as `!important`.
  - [ ] HTML syntax highlighting.

## Usage
If you'd like to use this editor in your project, follow these steps:
- Install `node-sass` in your project (or you could convert the Sass files (or write custom styling in CSS)
- Clone this project to your local machine
- Copy the `Editor` directory from Components into your project
- Copy everything from the `modules` directory into your project
- The `Editor` component requires a `snippet` prop which consists of an object, like [this one](./src/Store/snippets/demo.js).
  - An `onComplete` prop is necessary if you intend to use the interactive capabilities.

-----------------------

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
